# TODO

- update makefile to account for include dependencies.
- merge the following files:
  - `src/item.cc` and `src/data/{tools,foods,articles,products}.c`.
- finish decompiling m4a (port from pokeemerald)
  - maybe replace offset labels as they are also from pokeemerald
- decompile the rest of the game
